## About Luxid

**Luxid** is a lightweight, modern PHP framework designed with simplicity and speed in mind.
Built for developers who want full control over their application architecture, Luxid provides a clean routing system, a flexible screen rendering engine, and an elegant structure for building powerful applications in a custom architecture called SEA [Screen(View) - Entities(Models) - Actions(Controllers)]

Luxid focuses on:

- Clear and expressive routing
- Simple and intuitive actions (controllers)
- A lightweight screen/template engine (`.nova.php`)
- Easy request/response handling
- Minimal setup, maximum flexibility

Luxid removes the unnecessary complexity of large frameworks and gives developers a clean, enjoyable development experience.

## Key Features

- **Fast routing engine** with support for GET/POST and callbacks
- **Action-based controllers** (cleaner than classical MVC)
- Simple `.nova.php` **screen rendering system**
- Framework-level request sanitization
- Extensible architecture
- Easily readable, elegant syntax
- Zero-dependency core (other than Composer autoloading)

Luxid is ideal for small-to-medium web apps, APIs, school management systems, dashboards, and learning modern PHP framework design.

## Learning Luxid

Luxid includes clear documentation (coming soon) and is intentionally designed to be beginner-friendly for developers learning framework architecture.

A step-by-step guide and examples will be available soon in the `/docs` directory.

Until then, you can explore:

- The `screens/` folder – UI screens
- The `actions/` folder – controllers
- `system/` – the framework core (Router, Request, Response, Action, etc.)
